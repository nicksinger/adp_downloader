This script downloads payslips from [adpworld.de](https://www.adpworld.de)'s ePayslip application. It does not require any manual link extraction
and supports the download of all availible documents. Just configure you company, username and password, run the script and
find all downloads conveniently placed on you HDD.

**Note:** this script was developed with and for accounts [@SUSE](https://github.com/SUSE). If you do not work for SUSE be warned
that it might break and does not work at all. Feel free to try it anyway and report your findings as github issues :+1:.

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/nicksinger/adp_downloader.git
cd adp_downloader
mkdir downloads
```

**Note** for openSUSE users: Make sure you've installed `python3-requests` and `python3-beautifulsoup4`:

```
zypper in python3-requests python3-beautifulsoup4
```

Alternatively and for development you can get all development requirements
with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Configuration

Use your browsers developer tools or an extension like
[cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) to
extract the cookie which will be downloaded as `cookies.txt`

Create a config.ini in the same directory (NOT the newly created `downloads`
directory!). The file has to have the following format:

```
[credentials]
cookie = your_emeasmsession_cookie
```

where "your_emeasmsession_cookie" corresponds to the `EMEASMSESSION`-cookie
set by the web application after you logged in. This is a very long string in
the downloaded file `cookies.txt` next to `EMEASMSESSION`.

**Note** `config.ini` needs to be in the same directory as
the script downloader.py.


# Execution

Simply run `python downloader.py` and watch it fetch your documents.

By default the downloader will create a local sqlite database to remember
already downloaded files. Each new execution of the downloader will only
download newly added files to your disk. This allows you to easily run the
downloader in a cron job.

**Note** If you are asked for your credentials to log in, then the script
didn't find the `config.ini` or `cookies.txt`.
